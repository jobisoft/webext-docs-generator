Getting started
===============

These documents assume you already have some familiarity with the WebExtension technology. If not, it is
highly recommended to start with the following pages:

* `Introduction to add-on development`__
* `Hello world Add-on tutorial`__

__ https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/about-add-ons
__ https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/hello-world-add-on

For any problems or feature requests please `file a bug`__.

__ https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Thunderbird&component=Add-Ons%3A+Extensions+API

.. hint::

  In Thunderbird, all WebExtension API can be accessed through the *browser.\** namespace, as with Firefox,
  but also through the  *messenger.\** namespace, which is a better fit for Thunderbird.

.. important::

  WebExtension APIs are asynchronous, that is, they return a `Promise`__ object which resolves when
  ready. See `Using Promises`__ for more information about Promises.

__ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
__ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises

The documentation for the APIs listed in the left side panel is generated automatically from
Thunderbird's schema files. The `webext-schemas <https://github.com/thunderbird/webext-annotated-schemas>`__
repository can be used to obtain a copy of the relevant files.
